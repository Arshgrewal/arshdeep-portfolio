        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a motivated and adaptable professional with expertise in sales, logistics, and property management. With over three years of experience, I have successfully led teams, optimized business operations, and ensured customer satisfaction. I specialize in managing inventory, coordinating schedules, and streamlining processes to enhance efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            My background also includes hands-on experience in property management, where I handled tenant coordination, rental maintenance, and minor renovations as a side business. I am seeking an opportunity in Nova Scotia, Canada, where I can contribute my skills in sales, management, or logistics.
